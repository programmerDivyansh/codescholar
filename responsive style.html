            <h2 id="heading">Media Queries</h2>
            <p>Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site or app depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser viewport width).</p>
            <p>Media queries can be used to check many things, such as: width and height of the viewport, width and height of the device, orientation (is the device in landscape or portrait mode?), resolution.</p>

            <h2 id="heading">Responsive Texts</h2>
            <p>Responsive typography is the practice of adjusting the font size, line height, and other typographic properties based on the screen size or device being used to view the content. This ensures that text remains legible and visually appealing across a wide range of devices, from small mobile screens to large desktop monitors.</p>

                    h1 {
                    font-size: 6vw; /* 6% of the viewport width */
         }

            <h2 id="heading">Responsive Images</h2>
            <p>Responsive images are images that adjust their size and resolution based on the device and screen size they are being viewed on. This ensures that images look good and load quickly on all devices, from small mobile screens to large desktop monitors.</p>

                <code>
                    &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"&gt;

            <h2 id="heading">Bootstrap</h2>
            <p>Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides a collection of CSS and JavaScript components that make it easy to create responsive layouts, navigation menus, forms, buttons, and other UI elements.</p>
            <p>Bootstrap uses a grid system that allows developers to create flexible and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. It also includes pre-designed components that can be easily customized to fit the needs of a particular project.</p>
